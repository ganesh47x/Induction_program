# üßë‚Äçüéì Induction Program - Day 1 (31 july 2025)
1. Gurudwara Sahib Visit (8:30 AM ‚Äì 9:30 AM)
The day started with a peaceful visit to the College Gurudwara Sahib. The atmosphere was really calming and gave me a positive vibe. It felt like the right way to begin this new phase of life. Everyone sat quietly and listened to the prayer. It kind of set the tone for the rest of the day ‚Äî peaceful and focused.

# 2. Auditorium Session (10:00 AM ‚Äì 1:00 PM)
After the Gurudwara Sahib visit, we all gathered in the auditorium for the main event of the day. The session was packed with valuable information and some really inspiring talks by the faculty and guests.

 Dr. Harpreet Kaur Grewal, Head of the Department of Applied Sciences, welcomed us warmly. She explained how important the foundation courses are for engineers and how they build the base for the upcoming years.

Dr. Sehijpal Singh, our Principal Sir, gave a motivating speech about discipline, using our time wisely, and how GNDEC has a proud legacy. His words genuinely made me feel like I made the right choice by joining this college.

Dr. Akshay Girdhar, Dean Academics, gave us an overview of how academics will go, how to keep a balance, and how students can get help if they‚Äôre facing any academic issues. He also mentioned the importance of consistent effort.

Dr. Parminder Singh, Dean Student Welfare, told us about the various student support systems, clubs, events, and general student life. He seemed really approachable and supportive. It made me feel more confident about adjusting to this new environment.

We also had two special guests:
 Ravinder Garg, Chief Engineer, shared his personal experiences and inspired us to aim high in our careers.
Er. Rakesh Kumar, GNDEC alumnus from the 1991 batch, spoke about his journey after college and how GNDEC played a key role in shaping his career. Listening to an alumnus was really motivating.
The session was finally concluded by Dr. K.S. Mann, Head of the IT Department. He gave us an overview of the IT department, future projects, and opportunities. He seemed really passionate about tech and encouraged us to stay updated and grab every chance to learn and grow.
